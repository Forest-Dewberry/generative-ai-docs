AAA
;afterTerm;
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) are security mechanisms that control access to computer systems and networks. AAA ensures only authorized users can access specific resources and tracks their activities. It is crucial for maintaining system security and compliance with regulations like HIPAA and PCI DSS.  

AAA involves three key processes:

* **Authentication:** Verifying a user or device's identity through methods like passwords, tokens, biometrics, or security questions.
* **Authorization:** Granting access rights based on the authenticated user's identity and privileges, determining their actions within the system.
* **Accounting:** Recording and monitoring user activity, including logins, logout times, accessed resources, and performed actions.

Related concepts include Access Control Lists (ACLs), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Single Sign-On (SSO), and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  Various methods are used for each process, such as password-based, token-based, and biometric authentication, and ACLs, RBAC, and attribute-based access control for authorization. Accounting relies on log files, auditing, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

Understanding AAA's components, methods, and related terms is critical for achieving effective security posture and compliance.

ACL
;afterTerm;
An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules used to control access to resources such as networks, files, or directories. Each rule defines specific permissions, like allowing or denying access, for different entities or users. ACLs are fundamental to security by enforcing access control policies. They restrict access to sensitive resources, enforce the principle of least privilege, track access attempts for security investigations, and enable role-based access control (RBAC). ACLs are employed in various security contexts including network security (firewalls, routers, and switches), operating systems, databases, and cloud services. Related terms include Access Control, Permissions, Authentication, Authorization, RBAC, Rule-based access control, Security Groups, and Network Segmentation. Understanding ACLs is crucial for security professionals as they are widely used in various security technologies and applications.

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used symmetric-key block cipher that encrypts data in 128-bit blocks using keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Its strength lies in its complex mathematical operations and resistance to known attacks, making it a cornerstone of secure communications and data storage.  AES is used in various applications, such as encrypting sensitive data stored on hard drives and databases, securing Wi-Fi networks using WPA2/WPA3 protocols, protecting data during VPN connections, and encrypting entire hard drives.  

AES is considered highly secure and its widespread adoption by the U.S. government and numerous organizations makes it a vital component for safeguarding sensitive information.  Understanding AES and its significance is essential for security professionals, who need to be able to implement secure systems and protect data from unauthorized access. This includes understanding the principles of symmetric-key cryptography, the operation of block ciphers, the impact of key size, various modes of operation like Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) and Counter (CTR), and the importance of secure key management.  

The Security+ 701 exam covers these cryptographic principles in detail, requiring professionals to understand different types of encryption algorithms, assess the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms like AES, apply cryptography concepts to real-world scenarios, and implement secure key management practices.

AES-256
;afterTerm;
AES 256-bit is a highly secure symmetric block cipher that uses the same key for encryption and decryption. It operates on 128-bit blocks and utilizes a 256-bit key, resulting in a massive 2^256 possible key combinations, making it extremely difficult to crack through brute force. Widely adopted by governments, businesses, and individuals, AES 256-bit serves as a cornerstone of data security. Its vast key space and proven resilience against cryptanalysis make it a reliable choice for protecting sensitive information.

AES 256-bit is employed for encrypting data at rest and in transit, including disk encryption (hard drives and SSDs), file encryption, and network encryption (VPNs and HTTPS). It forms a core component of various security standards, such as NIST, FIPS, and ISO/IEC.

Understanding the principles of encryption and decryption, including the role of keys, and the importance of protecting data at rest and in transit are essential for security professionals. AES 256-bit, as a robust and widely-used encryption standard, plays a crucial role in securing data in both the digital and physical worlds.

AH
;afterTerm;
The Authentication Header (AH) is a protocol within the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) framework that provides data integrity and authentication for IP packets. It ensures data hasn't been tampered with and verifies the sender's identity. 

AH uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to guarantee data integrity. This cryptographic checksum verifies that the information hasn't been altered during transmission. Additionally, AH leverages cryptographic techniques to authenticate the sender, preventing spoofing and impersonation. 

AH works in conjunction with the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol, which focuses on confidentiality through encryption.  

Within the Security+ 701 exam, AH is crucial for understanding IPsec and its protocols, the benefits and mechanisms of data integrity and authentication, and the role of cryptographic algorithms and MACs in securing communication. 

To ensure data integrity and authentication, AH operates as follows: the sender generates an AH header containing a MAC calculated from the packet's data and a shared secret key. This header is appended to the original packet and transmitted to the receiver. The receiver uses the same shared secret key to calculate the MAC and compares it to the received MAC. If they match, the data is verified as authentic and unaltered.

ALE
;afterTerm;
Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is a financial metric that quantifies the potential financial impact of a specific risk occurring over a year. It represents the expected monetary loss from a risk event in a given year, considering the frequency and impact of the event. ALE is crucial for risk management, allowing organizations to prioritize risks based on their potential financial impact and allocate resources effectively to mitigate them. Understanding ALE enables informed decisions about security investments, insurance coverage, and risk mitigation strategies. It also helps organizations meet regulatory requirements and demonstrate their commitment to risk management.

ALE is calculated through a quantitative risk analysis process, involving Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) and Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO). SLE represents the financial impact of a single occurrence of the risk event, while ARO estimates the number of times the risk event is likely to occur in a year. The formula for ALE is: ALE = SLE x ARO. 

Security+ 701 objectives related to ALE include understanding the concepts of risk management, applying quantitative risk analysis techniques, including calculating ALE, and identifying and analyzing potential risks to information systems and networks.

For example, a company with a data center facing the risk of power outages might have an SLE of $10,000 (lost revenue and data recovery costs) and an ARO of 0.5 per year. The ALE for this risk would be $5,000 ($10,000 x 0.5).

ALE is a valuable tool for quantifying risk and making informed security decisions. Understanding the concept and its calculation is essential for security professionals, particularly in the context of the Security+ 701 exam.
