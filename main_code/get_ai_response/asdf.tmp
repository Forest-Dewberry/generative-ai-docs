An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of definitions and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact. Acting as an intermediary, APIs enable applications to access specific functionalities or data from other applications without requiring knowledge of their internal workings. This makes APIs increasingly crucial in modern IT systems, making their security a critical aspect.  

The Security+ 701 exam focuses on understanding API attacks and vulnerabilities, such as those outlined in the OWASP API Security Top 10, including common attacks like Broken Object Level Authorization, Mass Assignment, and Injection attacks. It also emphasizes implementing secure API development practices, such as using authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting mechanisms to secure API endpoints. Additionally, the exam expects candidates to recognize and mitigate API security risks, including data leakage, unauthorized access, and denial-of-service attacks.

APIs are widely used in web applications to interact with backend services, databases, and external systems. Mobile applications frequently rely on APIs for functionalities like location services, social media integration, and payment processing. In microservices architecture, APIs play a key role in connecting and communicating between distributed services. 

Related terms include RESTful API, a type of API adhering to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style; API Gateway, a layer providing security, traffic management, and other functionalities; OAuth, an open standard protocol for authorization; Open API Specification (OAS), a standard for defining and documenting APIs; API Security Testing, a process of evaluating API security through various techniques; and API Management, a set of tools and processes for managing the entire API lifecycle.

Understanding APIs and their security implications is crucial for IT security professionals, especially those preparing for the Security+ 701 exam.
