ACL
;afterTerm;
An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules that determine which users or devices can access specific resources like files, folders, network devices, or websites. Each rule within an ACL specifies a user, group, or device and their permitted actions (e.g., read, write, execute). ACLs are essential for implementing access control and ensuring data security, forming a fundamental element of many security mechanisms, including firewalls, network devices, operating systems, and cloud platforms. By defining explicit access rules, ACLs prevent unauthorized access and maintain data integrity.

ACLs operate within the broader context of access control models such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which assigns permissions based on roles and responsibilities, and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which leverages user attributes and resource characteristics for fine-grained access control. The principle of least privilege, which grants only the minimum necessary permissions to users and devices, is also relevant.

Related terms include firewalls, which use ACLs to filter traffic, Network Access Control (NAC), which enforces security policies on network-accessing devices, and directory services like Active Directory, which manage user accounts, groups, and permissions, often utilizing ACLs. Other related terms include permissions, specific rights granted for accessing and manipulating resources; policies, high-level guidelines defining security objectives and informing ACL creation; and auditing, the process of reviewing access logs to monitor activity and identify potential security violations.

Examples of ACLs include firewall ACLs, which block traffic from specific IP addresses, prevent access to certain ports, or allow traffic only for specific protocols; file system ACLs, which restrict access to folders based on user groups or specific permissions (read, write, execute); and database ACLs, which define user permissions to read, write, or modify data within specific tables.

The Security+ 701 exam assesses your understanding of ACLs, their implementation for security controls, common deployment scenarios, and related concepts like RBAC and least privilege principles.

AH
;afterTerm;
The Authentication Header (AH) is a protocol within the IPsec suite designed for authenticating IP packets and ensuring data integrity. While it doesn't encrypt the packet's payload, it provides a digital signature to verify the sender's identity and prevent unauthorized modifications. AH guarantees data integrity by ensuring that received data matches what was sent, preventing tampering. It authenticates the source of the packet, confirming it originates from a trusted sender. This also contributes to non-repudiation, making it difficult for the sender to deny sending the message. By authenticating the sender and protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks, AH strengthens network security.  

AH operates at the network layer of the TCP/IP model and is used in conjunction with IPsec, a suite of protocols providing secure communication over IP networks. Related terms include ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), which encrypts the packet's payload alongside authentication; IKE (Internet Key Exchange), used for establishing secure connections between IPsec peers; digital signature, a cryptographic technique for verifying message authenticity and integrity; hash function, a mathematical function generating fixed-size strings for digital signatures; and integrity check, a mechanism ensuring data is unmodified in transit.

ALE
;afterTerm;
Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is a financial metric used to quantify the expected monetary loss from a specific risk over a year. It helps organizations prioritize security investments by focusing on risks with the highest potential financial impact. ALE is crucial for risk assessment and management. It allows organizations to understand which risks pose the greatest financial threat, prioritize their security efforts, make informed decisions about security investments, and determine insurance coverage needs. Some regulations and industry standards also require organizations to calculate ALE as part of their risk management process.

ALE is calculated by multiplying the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE), the estimated financial loss from a single occurrence of a specific risk, by the Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO), the estimated number of times a specific risk is expected to occur within a year. This formula can be expressed as: ALE = SLE x ARO.

For example, if a company has a server containing sensitive customer data with an estimated loss of $100,000 (SLE) and a 10% chance of a data breach occurring per year (ARO), the ALE would be $10,000 (ALE = $100,000 x 0.10). This means the company can expect to lose $10,000 per year due to a data breach on this server, providing valuable information for justifying investments in security controls that reduce the likelihood of a breach.

By understanding the concept of ALE and how to calculate it, security professionals can contribute to the effective management of security risks within their organizations. This includes understanding the role of ALE in risk assessment, calculating ALE using SLE and ARO, identifying and prioritizing risks based on ALE, and using ALE to make informed decisions about security investments.
